TY PROJECT
   
MAIN GOAL TO MAKE A WORKING PROJECT 
steps which are been taken already 
1)making a complete design ( which is partially done)can be completed sooner
2)tried converting with AI
 
THINGS TO LEARN FOR PROJECT
1)How to convert figma to code(source YOUTUBE CHATGPT ANY thing which can be helpful)
2)gaining knowledge about REACTJS ( same can be referred from YT AND CHATGPT ) so we might not face problem if we have some understanding 
3)and learning about converting app into web app(IF NEEDED)
4)FIGMA TO MAKE MORE BETTER DESIGN



steps which must be taken 
1)bringing complete design into coding or can say as working(so we can pitch to principal showing him a prototype)
and making him believe that this can be a game changer in our college campus
2)full fledge working model
3)making data base for collecting the data which be needed
4)firebase if needed
5)


goals to accomplish after completing our project
1)preparing a pitch to impress our principal and bringing him into our favor so he might take our college app 

if he ask
so why we need this app?
 as per my thinking i pointed out two points which might be helpful 
1)bringing digital college ID if i forgot my if card at home(can be explained after words )
2)bringing fees due payment into our app bringing reminder so tht we as a students are not been ashamed Infront of our class mates
 
and can be discussed further too
